replace LSOpenApplication() with LSOpenFromURLSpec()

use LSCopyApplicationURLsForBundleIdentifier() to find all installed apps with given bundle ID

problem: LSFindApplicationForInfo() has no LS replacement for looking up by app name; looks like -[NSWorkspace fullPathForApplication:] is only alternative
